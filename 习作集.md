### 题目：在新疆的挑战与成长

我从未想到，在中国新疆的旅行会如此深刻地影响我。这个广袤而神秘的地方，以其独特的地理环境和文化风情吸引着我。然而，旅途中的种种挑战也让我深刻地认识到自己应对困境的能力。

初到新疆，第一件让我措手不及的就是气候。这里的早晚温差极大，早晨还在为寒冷发抖，中午却又被灼热的阳光晒得汗流浃背。每次出门前，我都要仔细琢磨该穿多少衣服，才能在不同的时间段保持舒适。然而，这种反复的气候变化让我感到疲惫，也让我意识到，旅途中的每一刻都可能是对适应能力的考验。

不仅是气候，新疆的饮食习惯也让我一时难以适应。这里的食物多以羊肉和面食为主，味道浓烈而独特。尽管我尝试着去品味这些新奇的食物，但胃却并不买账。有一天晚上，我在凌晨4点被饿醒，房间里一片寂静，只有我一个人辗转反侧。饥饿和孤独让我第一次真正感受到，身处异地时，适应当地文化和生活方式的重要性。

更让我难忘的是一次和旅游团的失散经历。那天，我们在乌鲁木齐的国际大巴扎游览，这个充满异域风情的市场让人目不暇接。我沉浸在琳琅满目的手工艺品和香料的世界里，直到抬头发现，原本在身边的团友们已经不见踪影。我突然意识到自己被人群淹没了，心中顿时涌起一股不安的情绪。那一刻，我深深体会到了“茫然”这个词的含义。在异国他乡，语言的不通和环境的陌生让我感到无助。然而，我努力让自己冷静下来，通过向当地人询问方向，终于重新找到了团队。

最后一天，在克拉玛依，我迎来了旅途中最大的挑战。我们准备坐飞机返回，但由于误判了出发时间，我和团队失去了联系。我独自一人在机场的候机厅，看着即将起飞的航班，感受到一种无法形容的焦虑和无力。那一刻，我意识到，即便事先计划得再周密，也会有意外发生，旅行就是这样充满不确定性。我最终不得不改签航班，并重新规划回程。

这次新疆之行让我学到了很多。面对气候的变化，我学会了如何调整自己的节奏；在适应饮食的过程中，我学会了包容和接受不同的文化；而在与团队失散和错过航班的经历中，我学会了冷静处理突发状况，并在困境中寻求解决办法。这次旅行不仅丰富了我的阅历，也让我明白了在面对未知和挑战时，适应力和应变能力是多么的重要。

回顾这段旅程，我不再只是记得新疆壮丽的风景和丰富的文化，更重要的是，我认识到自己在这段旅程中变得更加坚强和成熟。每一次挑战和困境，都让我更加清楚地认识到自己的潜力和能力。在未来的旅途中，无论面对怎样的困难，我都将以更加开放和坚毅的心态去迎接。

### Title: Challenges and Growth in Xinjiang

I never expected that my trip to Xinjiang, China, would have such a profound impact on me. This vast and mysterious region, with its unique geography and cultural charm, fascinated me. However, the challenges I encountered during the journey also made me deeply aware of my ability to cope with difficulties.

The first thing that caught me off guard upon arriving in Xinjiang was the climate. The temperature fluctuations between morning and evening were extreme—shivering in the cold early in the morning and sweating under the scorching midday sun. Each time before heading out, I had to carefully consider how many layers to wear to stay comfortable throughout the day. This constant change in weather left me exhausted and made me realize that every moment of the journey could be a test of adaptability.

It wasn't just the climate; the local cuisine also took some getting used to. Xinjiang’s food, rich in mutton and noodles with strong, distinctive flavors, was far from what I was accustomed to. Despite my efforts to appreciate these new tastes, my stomach disagreed. One night, I woke up at 4 a.m., feeling ravenously hungry. The room was silent, and I was alone, tossing and turning. Hunger and solitude made me truly understand the importance of adapting to local customs and lifestyles when in a foreign land.

One of the most unforgettable experiences was getting separated from the tour group. We were exploring the International Grand Bazaar in Urumqi, a market filled with exotic goods and spices. I was completely absorbed in the vibrant array of handcrafted items when I looked up and realized my group had vanished. Suddenly, a sense of unease overwhelmed me as I found myself lost in the crowd. At that moment, I truly grasped the meaning of the word "bewildered." In a foreign country, with unfamiliar surroundings and language barriers, I felt helpless. However, I forced myself to stay calm and eventually found my way back to the group by asking locals for directions.

The final day in Karamay presented the biggest challenge of the trip. We were preparing to fly back, but due to a misjudgment of the departure time, I lost contact with the group. Alone in the airport's waiting area, watching the plane I was supposed to be on prepare for takeoff, I felt an indescribable anxiety and helplessness. At that moment, I realized that no matter how meticulously plans are made, unexpected events can still occur. Travel is full of uncertainties. I ended up having to reschedule my flight and replan my return journey.

This journey to Xinjiang taught me a lot. Facing the changing climate, I learned how to adjust my pace; in adapting to the food, I learned to embrace and accept different cultures; and through the experiences of getting separated from the group and missing the flight, I learned to remain calm in the face of unexpected situations and to seek solutions in times of difficulty. This trip not only enriched my experiences but also made me realize the importance of adaptability and resilience when facing the unknown and challenging situations.

Looking back on this journey, what stays with me is not just the magnificent landscapes and rich culture of Xinjiang, but more importantly, how I became stronger and more mature through this journey. Each challenge and hardship revealed more of my potential and capabilities. In future travels, no matter what difficulties I may face, I will approach them with a more open and determined mindset.

### 题目：在新疆的成长与自我发现

新疆，这片辽阔而神秘的土地，以其独特的自然风光和多样的文化魅力吸引着我。然而，当我踏上这片土地时，才意识到这次旅程不仅是对风景的欣赏，更是一次自我挑战与成长的历程。

新疆的气候变化让我措手不及。早晨的寒冷和中午的炽热形成了强烈的对比，这种温差让我意识到，真正的旅行不仅是眼睛的享受，更是心灵的磨砺。每一天的气候变化，都让我重新审视自己的适应能力和应变能力。

旅程中最让我难忘的是一次与旅游团失散的经历。在乌鲁木齐的国际大巴扎，我沉浸在琳琅满目的手工艺品中，却不知不觉与团队失去了联系。陌生的环境和语言障碍让我一度感到无助和恐慌，但我努力镇定下来，通过向当地人寻求帮助，最终找回了团队。这次经历让我明白，冷静与主动应对是面对突发状况时最有效的解决之道。

此外，与旅伴的同住也成了一大挑战。他响亮的鼾声让我每晚难以入睡，这让我意识到，在旅途中学会与环境和他人相处同样重要。经过几天的挣扎，我尝试了各种方法，最终找到了一些让自己休息的方法。

在克拉玛依，我错过了航班。这让我深刻体会到旅行中的不确定性，以及应对意外的必要性。尽管这次旅行充满挑战，但它让我学会了如何在困境中寻找解决办法，并从中成长。

回顾这次新疆之行，我不仅欣赏到了美丽的风景，更在旅途中经历了深刻的自我发现。每一次的挑战和困境，都让我变得更加坚韧和自信。无论未来的旅程多么艰难，我都将以更加开放的心态迎接每一个新的挑战。

### Title: Growth and Self-Discovery in Xinjiang

Xinjiang, with its vast landscapes and rich cultural heritage, had always captivated me. However, when I finally set foot on this land, I realized that this journey was not just about admiring the scenery; it was also a journey of self-challenge and growth.

The unpredictable climate of Xinjiang caught me off guard. The sharp contrast between the cold mornings and scorching afternoons made me aware that true travel is not just about visual enjoyment but also about mental resilience. Each day’s temperature fluctuations pushed me to reassess my adaptability and problem-solving abilities.

One of the most unforgettable moments was when I got separated from my tour group at the International Grand Bazaar in Urumqi. I was so absorbed in the vibrant array of handmade crafts that I lost track of time and eventually lost sight of the group. The unfamiliar environment and language barriers left me feeling helpless and panicked, but I forced myself to stay calm. By seeking help from locals, I was eventually able to rejoin the group. This experience taught me that staying calm and being proactive are the best ways to handle unexpected situations.

Additionally, sharing a room with my travel companion posed another challenge. His loud snoring kept me awake every night, making it difficult to rest. This experience made me realize the importance of learning to adapt to one’s environment and coexisting with others while traveling. After a few sleepless nights, I tried different methods and eventually found ways to get some rest.

### 标题：连接两种世界

当我十岁时，站在机场的登机口，望着身后的故乡——中国杭州，我不知道等待我的是什么。我的心情既兴奋又忐忑，因为我将告别那个熟悉的世界，踏上通往美国北卡罗来纳州Apex的航程。我不知道的是，这次旅程不仅仅是跨越地理距离，更是一场跨越文化的探索，它将挑战我对身份的认知，重新塑造我对世界的理解。

在杭州，我的生活被课本和课外作业占据。严格的教育体系几乎不给课外活动留有余地。我的日常安排得非常紧凑，每一个成就都由分数来衡量。而在Apex，一切都截然不同。新学校几乎没有课外作业，教学重点似乎也不在记忆背诵，而在于探索和创造力。起初，这种缺乏结构的学习方式让我感到迷茫，就像进入了一场没有规则的游戏。

我努力在这个陌生的环境中寻找自己的位置。我怀念旧学校的熟悉感，也怀念那些清晰的目标和期望。但随着时间的推移，我开始发现美国教育方式中的独特魅力。这里的学习不仅仅是吸收知识，而是关于提问、批判性思考以及找到自己的声音。

这种转变并不轻松。有时我觉得自己像个局外人，夹在两种文化之间，无法完全融入任何一个。当我在课堂上发言时，常常会担心我的口音或不同的观点会让我显得格格不入。但逐渐地，我明白了，这些差异并不是障碍，而是让我得以跨越不同文化的桥梁。我的背景赋予了我一种独特的视角，让我可以把中国教育的严谨和美国教育的开放结合起来，以自己的方式看待世界。

这种双重身份成了我的优势。我开始意识到，自己可以在两种文化之间自由游走，汲取它们各自的精华，为自己铺就独特的道路。在历史课上，我将古老的中国哲学与西方政治思想联系起来。在科学课上，我用一种严谨的思维方式来解决问题，同时又保留着一种探索未知的好奇心。课外活动中，我加入了社团和运动队，在团队合作和沟通中，我学会了跨越语言和文化的界限。

从杭州到Apex的旅程不仅教会了我课本上的知识，也让我在面对变化时变得更加坚韧，让我明白了视角的重要性，以及勇于拥抱未知的价值。它让我看到，世界并非黑白分明，而是由各种经历和思想交织而成的一幅丰富图景，每一种色彩都为这幅画增添了独特的层次。

站在新篇章的起点，我知道这些经历将伴随我一生。它们将指引我在未来的挑战和机遇中前行。我的旅程不仅仅是适应和成长的过程，更是一段不断发现世界、发现自我的探索之旅。我已经准备好迈出下一步，继续在我熟悉的世界之间搭建桥梁，开创属于自己的未来之路。

### Essay: Bridging Two Worlds

When I was ten years old, standing at the airport gate and looking back at my hometown—Hangzhou, China—I had no idea what lay ahead. My emotions were a mix of excitement and apprehension as I prepared to leave behind the familiar world I knew and embark on a journey to Apex, North Carolina, in the United States. What I didn’t realize was that this journey wasn’t just about crossing geographical distances; it was a cultural exploration that would challenge my sense of identity and reshape my understanding of the world.

In Hangzhou, my life was consumed by textbooks and after-school assignments. The strict educational system left little room for anything outside academics. My days were meticulously structured, with every achievement measured by grades. But in Apex, everything was completely different. My new school had almost no homework, and the focus seemed to be less on rote memorization and more on exploration and creativity. At first, this lack of structure left me feeling lost, as if I had entered a game without knowing the rules.

I struggled to find my place in this unfamiliar environment. I missed the familiarity of my old school, the clear goals, and the expectations that came with it. But as time passed, I began to discover the unique charm of the American educational approach. Learning here wasn’t just about absorbing knowledge; it was about asking questions, thinking critically, and finding my own voice.

This transition was not easy. There were times when I felt like an outsider, caught between two cultures, unable to fully belong to either. In class, I often hesitated to speak up, worried that my accent or different perspective might set me apart. But gradually, I realized that these differences were not barriers but bridges that allowed me to navigate between cultures. My background gave me a unique lens through which to view the world, combining the discipline of Chinese education with the openness of the American approach.

This dual identity became my strength. I began to see how I could move freely between these two cultures, drawing on the best of each to forge my own path. In history class, I connected the ancient philosophies of China with Western political thought. In science, I approached problems with a rigorous mindset, while also maintaining a curiosity that encouraged experimentation. Outside the classroom, I joined clubs and sports teams, where I learned the importance of teamwork and communication—skills that transcend language and cultural boundaries.

My journey from Hangzhou to Apex taught me more than just textbook knowledge. It taught me resilience in the face of change, the importance of perspective, and the value of embracing the unknown. It showed me that the world is not divided into black and white, but is a rich tapestry of experiences and ideas, each adding its own unique color to the picture.

As I stand on the brink of a new chapter, I know that these experiences will stay with me for life. They will guide me as I navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. My journey has been one of adaptation and growth, but it has also been one of discovery—of the world around me and of myself. I am ready to take the next step, to continue building bridges between the worlds I have come to know, and to create my own path forward.

### 题目：在文化之间航行

十岁那年，当我站在机场登机口，回望我的家乡——中国杭州时，我并不知道前方等待我的是什么。我怀着既兴奋又忐忑的心情，准备离开熟悉的世界，踏上前往美国北卡罗来纳州Apex的旅程。我未曾想到，这不仅仅是跨越地理距离，更是一场文化探索，它将挑战我的身份认知，并重新塑造我对教育和世界的理解。

在杭州，我的生活被课本和作业填满。中国的教育体系重视基础知识，课程设置全国统一，教学以教师为中心，师生关系正式而严肃。尊敬老师、遵守行为规范是每个学生的基本要求，这种尊师重教的理念深受孔子思想的影响。成绩成为衡量一切的标准，课外活动时间有限，大部分时间都用于学习。

然而，在Apex，一切都截然不同。美国的学校强调全面发展，课程设置灵活，学生可以根据兴趣选择选修课，教学方式更加互动，鼓励提问和讨论。课堂参与和日常表现成为评价标准，考试不再是唯一的衡量标准。然而，美国学校的平等观念也带来了一些挑战。学生与教师的关系更为平等，但这种平等有时导致了纪律松散。例如，我亲眼看到一些同学在校内吸食大麻，还有人公开辱骂老师。这样的行为在中国是难以想象的，因为尊重老师被视为一种基本的社会规范。

这种转变让我感到迷茫，仿佛进入了一个陌生的游戏。我怀念旧学校的熟悉感和明确的目标，但随着时间的推移，我开始欣赏这种新的教育方式。学习不仅是吸收知识，更是探索新思想，发展批判性思维和个人兴趣。我也逐渐理解了中美教育的不同，明白了每种教育体系背后所反映的文化价值观。

尽管适应不易，我逐渐意识到，这种双重文化背景成了我的优势。我的背景赋予了我一种独特的视角，能够将中国教育的严谨与美国教育的开放结合起来。在历史课上，我将中国哲学与西方政治思想联系起来；在科学课上，我保持严谨思维的同时，也探索创新。课外活动中，我参与社团和运动队，学会了在不同文化间自由切换。

课外活动的重要性在中美两国有明显差异。在中国，课外活动较少，主要时间用于学业；而在美国，课外活动是学校生活的重要组成部分，培养学生的团队合作和领导能力。我积极参与这些活动，意识到它们不仅丰富了我的教育体验，也拓宽了我的视野。

从杭州到Apex的旅程，不仅教会了我课本知识，更让我在面对变化时变得坚韧，理解了视角的重要性，以及勇于拥抱未知的价值。教育和世界并非简单划分，而是由各种经历和思想交织成的丰富图景。我已准备好迈出下一步，继续在我熟悉的世界之间搭建桥梁，开创属于自己的未来之路。

### Essay: Navigating Between Cultures

When I was ten years old, standing at the airport gate and looking back at my hometown—Hangzhou, China—I had no idea what lay ahead. My emotions were a mix of excitement and apprehension as I prepared to leave the familiar world I knew and embark on a journey to Apex, North Carolina, in the United States. What I didn’t realize was that this journey wasn’t just about crossing geographical distances; it was a cultural exploration that would challenge my sense of identity and reshape my understanding of education and the world.

In Hangzhou, my life was filled with textbooks and homework. The Chinese education system places a strong emphasis on mastering foundational knowledge, with a standardized curriculum nationwide. Teaching is teacher-centered, with a formal and respectful relationship between students and teachers. Respecting teachers and adhering to behavioral norms are fundamental expectations, deeply rooted in Confucian values. Academic performance is the primary measure of success, and extracurricular activities are limited, with most of the time devoted to studying.

However, in Apex, everything was completely different. American schools emphasize holistic development, with a flexible curriculum that allows students to choose elective courses based on their interests. Teaching is more interactive, encouraging questions and discussions. Classroom participation and daily engagement are key evaluation criteria, with exams no longer the sole measure of success. Yet, the American emphasis on equality between students and teachers also presents challenges. The more casual and equal relationship can sometimes lead to a lack of discipline. For example, I witnessed students using marijuana on school grounds and openly disrespecting teachers—behavior that would be unimaginable in China, where respecting teachers is a basic social norm.

This transition left me feeling lost, as if I had entered a new game without knowing the rules. I missed the familiarity of my old school and the clear expectations it provided. But as time passed, I began to appreciate the unique aspects of this new educational system. Learning was not just about absorbing knowledge; it was about exploring new ideas, developing critical thinking, and pursuing personal interests. I also came to understand the cultural values behind the differences in education systems in China and the United States.

Despite the challenges of adapting, I gradually realized that my dual cultural background had become my strength. It gave me a unique perspective, allowing me to blend the rigor of Chinese education with the openness and creativity of American education. In history class, I connected ancient Chinese philosophies with Western political thought; in science, I maintained a rigorous approach while embracing innovation. In extracurricular activities, I joined clubs and sports teams, learning to navigate between different cultures seamlessly.

The significance of extracurricular activities also stood out to me. In China, extracurricular activities are limited, with most of the focus on academics. In contrast, in the U.S., they are an integral part of school life, helping students develop leadership, teamwork, and social skills. I actively participated in these activities, realizing that they not only enriched my educational experience but also broadened my perspective.

My journey from Hangzhou to Apex taught me more than just textbook knowledge. It taught me resilience in the face of change, the importance of perspective, and the value of embracing the unknown. It showed me that education and the world are not simply divided into rigid structures, but are rich tapestries of experiences and ideas, each adding its own unique color to the picture. I am ready to take the next step, to continue building bridges between the worlds I have come to know, and to create my own path forward.

以下是以交易大麻的对话开头的修改版Essay：

## 习作五（文化认同）
### 标题：拥抱我的文化拼图

“你要多少？”一个同学低声问道。

“给我一克吧。”另一个同学回答道。

我站在走廊的另一端，目睹了这一幕，心中震惊不已。那是我第一次亲眼看到有人在学校里交易大麻。对于从中国杭州移居美国的我来说，这样的场景完全超出了我的认知。我的脑海中不禁开始思考，中美两国的中小学教育为何会有如此巨大的差异。

在中国，中小学教育强调学生的行为规范和对老师的尊重，这是根植于儒家文化的传统。我习惯了严格的课堂纪律和明确的师生关系。然而，在美国，我注意到学生与老师之间的互动更加随意，甚至在路上见到陌生人时也要主动打招呼，这种文化中的平等理念令我感到震惊。对我来说，这种人人平等的观念与我之前接受的教育大不相同，也促使我开始反思文化差异对人际关系和社会行为的影响。

在8到10岁期间，我受到了作为科学家的父亲的影响，阅读了大量关于全球历史、文化和艺术的书籍，尤其偏爱欧洲文艺复兴的历史。文艺复兴时期的思想解放和文化复兴深深吸引了我，让我对人类的创造力和理性有了初步的认识。这段经历塑造了我对世界的理解，也让我在面对文化差异时有了更多的思考维度。

随着时间的推移，我逐渐适应了美国的生活，但这种适应的过程并非一帆风顺。美国的课堂管理相对宽松，学生之间的关系更加平等开放，这与我从中国带来的严谨的教育理念形成了鲜明对比。更令人不安的是，美国的枪支管理不够严格，治安问题也时常让我担忧。这些经历迫使我在中美两种文化之间寻找平衡，并试图理解其中的差异。

中国的大城市看起来非常繁荣，中小学生有严格的行为规范，个人不允许拥有枪支，社会治安相对较好。然而，中国也有其弊端，最为显著的是缺乏自由和民主，言论自由受到限制。这让我对两种文化有了更深的思考。我开始意识到，在美国，尽管存在一些让我不安的问题，但这里的言论自由让我能够表达我的想法，而在中国，这样的自由却是有限的。

在学校里，我对历史和哲学的热爱不断增长。我发现自己被文化认同、社会进化以及长期以来吸引着思想家的哲学问题所吸引。通过比较中美两国的教育系统和文化，我意识到文化背景如何塑造了我们的行为方式和思想观念。

我开始欣赏我的文化背景的丰富性，以及它如何塑造了我的世界观。我学会了在传统与适应之间保持平衡，如何在尊重我的根源的同时，接受前方的新道路。

在我准备进入大学之际，我渴望继续探索文化与思想的交汇点。我希望深入研究历史、哲学和文化研究领域，利用我独特的背景为学术界做出贡献。从杭州到北卡罗来纳的旅程，是一个充满发现、坚韧和成长的过程。它塑造了今天的我——一个渴望学习、勇于质疑并愿意与周围世界建立联系的人。

在拥抱我的文化拼图中，我找到了自己的声音、热情和目标。我已准备好在我的教育旅程中迈出下一步，将过去的经验教训与未来的梦想一同带上前行的道路。

### Title： Embracing My Cultural Mosaic

"How much do you want?" one student whispered.

"Give me a gram," the other replied.

I stood at the other end of the hallway, witnessing this scene in shock. It was the first time I had ever seen someone dealing marijuana at school. Coming from Hangzhou, China, to the United States, this scene was completely beyond my comprehension. My mind couldn't help but wonder why there was such a vast difference between primary and secondary education in China and the United States.

In China, primary and secondary education emphasizes student behavior norms and respect for teachers, deeply rooted in Confucian traditions. I was accustomed to strict classroom discipline and clear teacher-student relationships. However, in the United States, I noticed that the interactions between students and teachers were much more casual, and even on the street, people would greet strangers. This cultural value of equality surprised me. It was vastly different from the education I had received in China and prompted me to reflect on how cultural differences impact interpersonal relationships and social behavior.

Between the ages of 8 to 10, under the influence of my father, a scientist, I read extensively about global history, culture, and art, with a particular interest in the history of the European Renaissance. The intellectual liberation and cultural revival of the Renaissance deeply fascinated me, giving me an initial understanding of human creativity and rationality. This experience shaped my understanding of the world and provided me with more dimensions to think about when facing cultural differences.

As time passed, I gradually adapted to life in the United States, but this adaptation process was not without its challenges. Classroom management in the U.S. was relatively relaxed, and student relationships were more equal and open, which stood in stark contrast to the rigorous educational principles I brought from China. What concerned me even more was the lack of strict gun control and frequent public safety issues in the United States. These experiences forced me to find a balance between Chinese and American cultures and to try to understand the differences between them.

China's big cities appear very prosperous, and primary and secondary school students have strict behavior norms. Individuals are not allowed to own guns, and public safety is relatively good. However, China also has its drawbacks, the most significant being a lack of freedom and democracy, with limited freedom of speech. This led me to think more deeply about both cultures. I began to realize that, despite some concerns in the U.S., the freedom of expression here allows me to voice my thoughts, something that is limited in China.

In school, my love for history and philosophy continued to grow. I found myself increasingly drawn to issues of cultural identity, social evolution, and the philosophical questions that have intrigued thinkers for centuries. By comparing the educational systems and cultures of China and the United States, I became aware of how cultural backgrounds shape our behaviors and beliefs.

I started to appreciate the richness of my cultural background and how it has shaped my worldview. I learned how to maintain a balance between tradition and adaptation, respecting my roots while embracing the new paths ahead.

As I prepare to enter college, I am eager to continue exploring the intersection of culture and thought. I hope to delve into the fields of history, philosophy, and cultural studies, using my unique background to contribute to the academic community. The journey from Hangzhou to North Carolina has been one of discovery, resilience, and growth. It has shaped me into who I am today—a person eager to learn, ready to question, and willing to connect with the world around me.

In embracing my cultural mosaic, I have found my voice, passion, and purpose. I am ready to take the next step in my educational journey, carrying with me the lessons of the past and the dreams for the future.
