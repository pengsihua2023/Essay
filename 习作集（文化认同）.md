### 题目：在文化之间航行

十岁那年，当我站在机场登机口，回望我的家乡——中国杭州时，我并不知道前方等待我的是什么。我怀着既兴奋又忐忑的心情，准备离开熟悉的世界，踏上前往美国北卡罗来纳州Apex的旅程。我未曾想到，这不仅仅是跨越地理距离，更是一场文化探索，它将挑战我的身份认知，并重新塑造我对教育和世界的理解。

在杭州，我的生活被课本和作业填满。中国的教育体系重视基础知识，课程设置全国统一，教学以教师为中心，师生关系正式而严肃。尊敬老师、遵守行为规范是每个学生的基本要求，这种尊师重教的理念深受孔子思想的影响。成绩成为衡量一切的标准，课外活动时间有限，大部分时间都用于学习。

然而，在Apex，一切都截然不同。美国的学校强调全面发展，课程设置灵活，学生可以根据兴趣选择选修课，教学方式更加互动，鼓励提问和讨论。课堂参与和日常表现成为评价标准，考试不再是唯一的衡量标准。然而，美国学校的平等观念也带来了一些挑战。学生与教师的关系更为平等，但这种平等有时导致了纪律松散。例如，我亲眼看到一些同学在校内吸食大麻，还有人公开辱骂老师。这样的行为在中国是难以想象的，因为尊重老师被视为一种基本的社会规范。

这种转变让我感到迷茫，仿佛进入了一个陌生的游戏。我怀念旧学校的熟悉感和明确的目标，但随着时间的推移，我开始欣赏这种新的教育方式。学习不仅是吸收知识，更是探索新思想，发展批判性思维和个人兴趣。我也逐渐理解了中美教育的不同，明白了每种教育体系背后所反映的文化价值观。

尽管适应不易，我逐渐意识到，这种双重文化背景成了我的优势。我的背景赋予了我一种独特的视角，能够将中国教育的严谨与美国教育的开放结合起来。在历史课上，我将中国哲学与西方政治思想联系起来；在科学课上，我保持严谨思维的同时，也探索创新。课外活动中，我参与社团和运动队，学会了在不同文化间自由切换。

课外活动的重要性在中美两国有明显差异。在中国，课外活动较少，主要时间用于学业；而在美国，课外活动是学校生活的重要组成部分，培养学生的团队合作和领导能力。我积极参与这些活动，意识到它们不仅丰富了我的教育体验，也拓宽了我的视野。

从杭州到Apex的旅程，不仅教会了我课本知识，更让我在面对变化时变得坚韧，理解了视角的重要性，以及勇于拥抱未知的价值。教育和世界并非简单划分，而是由各种经历和思想交织成的丰富图景。我已准备好迈出下一步，继续在我熟悉的世界之间搭建桥梁，开创属于自己的未来之路。

### Essay: Navigating Between Cultures

When I was ten years old, standing at the airport gate and looking back at my hometown—Hangzhou, China—I had no idea what lay ahead. My emotions were a mix of excitement and apprehension as I prepared to leave the familiar world I knew and embark on a journey to Apex, North Carolina, in the United States. What I didn’t realize was that this journey wasn’t just about crossing geographical distances; it was a cultural exploration that would challenge my sense of identity and reshape my understanding of education and the world.

In Hangzhou, my life was filled with textbooks and homework. The Chinese education system places a strong emphasis on mastering foundational knowledge, with a standardized curriculum nationwide. Teaching is teacher-centered, with a formal and respectful relationship between students and teachers. Respecting teachers and adhering to behavioral norms are fundamental expectations, deeply rooted in Confucian values. Academic performance is the primary measure of success, and extracurricular activities are limited, with most of the time devoted to studying.

However, in Apex, everything was completely different. American schools emphasize holistic development, with a flexible curriculum that allows students to choose elective courses based on their interests. Teaching is more interactive, encouraging questions and discussions. Classroom participation and daily engagement are key evaluation criteria, with exams no longer the sole measure of success. Yet, the American emphasis on equality between students and teachers also presents challenges. The more casual and equal relationship can sometimes lead to a lack of discipline. For example, I witnessed students using marijuana on school grounds and openly disrespecting teachers—behavior that would be unimaginable in China, where respecting teachers is a basic social norm.

This transition left me feeling lost, as if I had entered a new game without knowing the rules. I missed the familiarity of my old school and the clear expectations it provided. But as time passed, I began to appreciate the unique aspects of this new educational system. Learning was not just about absorbing knowledge; it was about exploring new ideas, developing critical thinking, and pursuing personal interests. I also came to understand the cultural values behind the differences in education systems in China and the United States.

Despite the challenges of adapting, I gradually realized that my dual cultural background had become my strength. It gave me a unique perspective, allowing me to blend the rigor of Chinese education with the openness and creativity of American education. In history class, I connected ancient Chinese philosophies with Western political thought; in science, I maintained a rigorous approach while embracing innovation. In extracurricular activities, I joined clubs and sports teams, learning to navigate between different cultures seamlessly.

The significance of extracurricular activities also stood out to me. In China, extracurricular activities are limited, with most of the focus on academics. In contrast, in the U.S., they are an integral part of school life, helping students develop leadership, teamwork, and social skills. I actively participated in these activities, realizing that they not only enriched my educational experience but also broadened my perspective.

My journey from Hangzhou to Apex taught me more than just textbook knowledge. It taught me resilience in the face of change, the importance of perspective, and the value of embracing the unknown. It showed me that education and the world are not simply divided into rigid structures, but are rich tapestries of experiences and ideas, each adding its own unique color to the picture. I am ready to take the next step, to continue building bridges between the worlds I have come to know, and to create my own path forward.

### 标题：拥抱我的文化拼图

“你要多少？”一个同学低声问道。

“给我一克吧。”另一个同学回答道。

我站在走廊的另一端，目睹了这一幕，心中震惊不已。那是我第一次亲眼看到有人在学校里交易大麻。对于从中国杭州移居美国的我来说，这样的场景完全超出了我的认知。我的脑海中不禁开始思考，中美两国的中小学教育为何会有如此巨大的差异。

在中国，中小学教育强调学生的行为规范和对老师的尊重，这是根植于儒家文化的传统。我习惯了严格的课堂纪律和明确的师生关系。然而，在美国，我注意到学生与老师之间的互动更加随意，甚至在路上见到陌生人时也要主动打招呼，这种文化中的平等理念令我感到震惊。对我来说，这种人人平等的观念与我之前接受的教育大不相同，也促使我开始反思文化差异对人际关系和社会行为的影响。

在8到10岁期间，我受到了作为科学家的父亲的影响，阅读了大量关于全球历史、文化和艺术的书籍，尤其偏爱欧洲文艺复兴的历史。文艺复兴时期的思想解放和文化复兴深深吸引了我，让我对人类的创造力和理性有了初步的认识。这段经历塑造了我对世界的理解，也让我在面对文化差异时有了更多的思考维度。

随着时间的推移，我逐渐适应了美国的生活，但这种适应的过程并非一帆风顺。美国的课堂管理相对宽松，学生之间的关系更加平等开放，这与我从中国带来的严谨的教育理念形成了鲜明对比。更令人不安的是，美国的枪支管理不够严格，治安问题也时常让我担忧。这些经历迫使我在中美两种文化之间寻找平衡，并试图理解其中的差异。

中国的大城市看起来非常繁荣，中小学生有严格的行为规范，个人不允许拥有枪支，社会治安相对较好。然而，中国也有其弊端，最为显著的是缺乏自由和民主，言论自由受到限制。这让我对两种文化有了更深的思考。我开始意识到，在美国，尽管存在一些让我不安的问题，但这里的言论自由让我能够表达我的想法，而在中国，这样的自由却是有限的。

在学校里，我对历史和哲学的热爱不断增长。我发现自己被文化认同、社会进化以及长期以来吸引着思想家的哲学问题所吸引。通过比较中美两国的教育系统和文化，我意识到文化背景如何塑造了我们的行为方式和思想观念。

我开始欣赏我的文化背景的丰富性，以及它如何塑造了我的世界观。我学会了在传统与适应之间保持平衡，如何在尊重我的根源的同时，接受前方的新道路。

在我准备进入大学之际，我渴望继续探索文化与思想的交汇点。我希望深入研究历史、哲学和文化研究领域，利用我独特的背景为学术界做出贡献。从杭州到北卡罗来纳的旅程，是一个充满发现、坚韧和成长的过程。它塑造了今天的我——一个渴望学习、勇于质疑并愿意与周围世界建立联系的人。

在拥抱我的文化拼图中，我找到了自己的声音、热情和目标。我已准备好在我的教育旅程中迈出下一步，将过去的经验教训与未来的梦想一同带上前行的道路。

### Title： Embracing My Cultural Mosaic

"How much do you want?" one student whispered.

"Give me a gram," the other replied.

I stood at the other end of the hallway, witnessing this scene in shock. It was the first time I had ever seen someone dealing marijuana at school. Coming from Hangzhou, China, to the United States, this scene was completely beyond my comprehension. My mind couldn't help but wonder why there was such a vast difference between primary and secondary education in China and the United States.

In China, primary and secondary education emphasizes student behavior norms and respect for teachers, deeply rooted in Confucian traditions. I was accustomed to strict classroom discipline and clear teacher-student relationships. However, in the United States, I noticed that the interactions between students and teachers were much more casual, and even on the street, people would greet strangers. This cultural value of equality surprised me. It was vastly different from the education I had received in China and prompted me to reflect on how cultural differences impact interpersonal relationships and social behavior.

Between the ages of 8 to 10, under the influence of my father, a scientist, I read extensively about global history, culture, and art, with a particular interest in the history of the European Renaissance. The intellectual liberation and cultural revival of the Renaissance deeply fascinated me, giving me an initial understanding of human creativity and rationality. This experience shaped my understanding of the world and provided me with more dimensions to think about when facing cultural differences.

As time passed, I gradually adapted to life in the United States, but this adaptation process was not without its challenges. Classroom management in the U.S. was relatively relaxed, and student relationships were more equal and open, which stood in stark contrast to the rigorous educational principles I brought from China. What concerned me even more was the lack of strict gun control and frequent public safety issues in the United States. These experiences forced me to find a balance between Chinese and American cultures and to try to understand the differences between them.

China's big cities appear very prosperous, and primary and secondary school students have strict behavior norms. Individuals are not allowed to own guns, and public safety is relatively good. However, China also has its drawbacks, the most significant being a lack of freedom and democracy, with limited freedom of speech. This led me to think more deeply about both cultures. I began to realize that, despite some concerns in the U.S., the freedom of expression here allows me to voice my thoughts, something that is limited in China.

In school, my love for history and philosophy continued to grow. I found myself increasingly drawn to issues of cultural identity, social evolution, and the philosophical questions that have intrigued thinkers for centuries. By comparing the educational systems and cultures of China and the United States, I became aware of how cultural backgrounds shape our behaviors and beliefs.

I started to appreciate the richness of my cultural background and how it has shaped my worldview. I learned how to maintain a balance between tradition and adaptation, respecting my roots while embracing the new paths ahead.

As I prepare to enter college, I am eager to continue exploring the intersection of culture and thought. I hope to delve into the fields of history, philosophy, and cultural studies, using my unique background to contribute to the academic community. The journey from Hangzhou to North Carolina has been one of discovery, resilience, and growth. It has shaped me into who I am today—a person eager to learn, ready to question, and willing to connect with the world around me.

In embracing my cultural mosaic, I have found my voice, passion, and purpose. I am ready to take the next step in my educational journey, carrying with me the lessons of the past and the dreams for the future.
